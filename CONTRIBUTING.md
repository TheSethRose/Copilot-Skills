      .github/prompts/{skill-name}.prompt.md
   
   cp .github/copilot-skills/templates/instructions.template.md \
      .github/instructions/{skill-name}.instructions.md
   ```

2. **Create skill directory** (if needed for scripts/details)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/copilot-skills/{skill-name}/scripts
   ```

3. **Follow the 5 Constitutional Principles**:
   - ‚úÖ Progressive Disclosure
   - ‚úÖ File-Based Organization
   - ‚úÖ Dynamic Discovery
   - ‚úÖ Deterministic Execution
   - ‚úÖ Composability

4. **Register in keyword routing map**
   - Add entry to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

5. **Document your skill**
   - Add README.md in skill directory
   - Include usage examples
   - Document all scripts

### Testing Your Skill

Before submitting:

1. **Test the workflow**
   ```
   /your-skill-name
   ```

2. **Verify scripts**
   ```bash
   # Test all scripts in scripts/ directory
   bash .github/copilot-skills/{skill-name}/scripts/script.sh --help
   ```

3. **Check constitutional compliance**

   bash .github/copilot-skills/document-project/scripts/validate_docs.sh \
        .github/copilot-skills/{skill-name}/
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### File Naming

- **Skills**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `pdf-handling`, `git-ops`)
- **Prompts**: `{skill-name}.prompt.md`
- **Instructions**: `{skill-name}.instructions.md`
- **Scripts**: Descriptive names with extension (e.g., `analyze_project.sh`)

### YAML Frontmatter

All prompt and instruction files must have YAML frontmatter:

**Prompt files**:
```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this skill does
model: Claude Sonnet 4  # Optional
tools: ['search', 'usages', 'fetch']  # Optional
---
```

**Instruction files**:
```yaml
---
description: Auto-loaded context description
---
```

### Markdown Style

- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- One blank line before and after headings
- Code blocks must have language tags
- Use relative links for internal docs
- Keep lines under 120 characters where reasonable

### Script Guidelines

**All scripts must**:
- Output to stdout/stderr only (no file generation)
- Include usage/help documentation
- Have proper error handling
- Exit with meaningful codes (0=success, 1=error)
- Be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include shebang line

**Example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 <arg>"
    echo "Description of what script does"
    exit 1
}

[[ $# -eq 0 ]] && usage
[[ "$1" == "-h" || "$1" == "--help" ]] && usage

# Script logic here
echo "Output to terminal only"
exit 0
```
