Send low-latency messages using the client libs, REST, or your Database.

You can use Realtime Broadcast to send low-latency messages between users. Messages can be sent using the client libraries, REST APIs, or directly from your database.

You can use the Supabase client libraries to receive Broadcast messages.

Go to your Supabase project's API Settings and grab the URL and anon public API key.

You can provide a callback for the broadcast channel to receive messages. This example will receive any broadcast messages that are sent to test-channel:

You can use the Supabase client libraries to send Broadcast messages.

This feature is in Public Beta. Submit a support ticket if you have any issues.

All the messages sent using Broadcast from the Database are stored in realtime.messages table and will be deleted after 3 days.

You can send messages directly from your database using the realtime.send() function:

It's a common use case to broadcast messages when a record is created, updated, or deleted. We provide a helper function specific to this use case, realtime.broadcast_changes(). For more details, check out the Subscribing to Database Changes guide.

You can send a Broadcast message by making an HTTP request to Realtime servers.

You can pass configuration options while initializing the Supabase Client.

By default, broadcast messages are only sent to other clients. You can broadcast messages back to the sender by setting Broadcast's self parameter to true.

You can confirm that the Realtime servers have received your message by setting Broadcast's ack config to true.

Use this to guarantee that the server has received the message before resolving channelD.send's promise. If the ack config is not set to true when creating the channel, the promise returned by channelD.send will resolve immediately.

You can also send a Broadcast message by making an HTTP request to Realtime servers. This is useful when you want to send messages from your server or client withou

Getting Started with Realtime

Learn how to build real-time applications with Supabase Realtime

Get your project URL and key.

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key. Get the URL from the API settings section of a project and the key from the the API Keys section of a project's Settings page.

Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can read the full announcement, but in the transition period, you can use both the current anon and service_role keys and the new publishable key with the form sb_publishable_xxx which will replace the older keys.

To get the key values, open the API Keys section of a project's Settings page and do the following:

Channels are the foundation of Realtime. Think of them as rooms where clients can communicate. Each channel is identified by a topic name and if they are public or private.

Since we're using a private channel, you need to create a basic RLS policy on the realtime.messages table to allow authenticated users to connect. Row Level Security (RLS) policies control who can access your Realtime channels based on user authentication and custom rules:

There are three main ways to send messages with Realtime:

Send and receive messages using the Supabase client:

Send messages via HTTP requests, perfect for server-side applications:

Automatically broadcast database changes using triggers. Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

Using realtime.broadcast_changes (Best for mirroring database changes)

Using realtime.send (Best for custom notifications and filtered data)

Always use private channels for production applications to ensure proper security and authorization:

Channel Topics: Use the pattern scope:id:entity

Always unsubscribe when you are done with a channel to ensure you free up resources:

Now that you understand the basics, dive deeper into

Share state between users with Realtime Presence.

Let's explore how to implement Realtime Presence to track state between multiple users.

You can use the Supabase client libraries to track Presence state between users.

Go to your Supabase project's API Settings and grab the URL and anon public API key.

Listen to the sync, join, and leave events triggered whenever any client joins or leaves the channel or changes their slice of state:

You can send state to all subscribers using track():

A client will receive state from any other client that is subscribed to the same topic (in this case room_01). It will also automatically trigger its own sync and join event handlers.

You can stop tracking presence using the untrack() method. This will trigger the sync and leave event handlers.

You can pass configuration options while initializing the Supabase Client.

By default, Presence will generate a unique UUIDv1 key on the server to track a client channel's state. If you prefer, you can provide a custom key when creating the channel. This key should be unique among clients.
