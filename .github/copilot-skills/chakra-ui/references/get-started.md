Configure AI assistants with Chakra UI v3 rules for better code generation

Configure your AI coding assistants (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Claude) by adding these rules to your project's .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md, or AI configuration file.

Create a file with the following rules in your project root:

Create a .cursorrules file in your project root. Then feel free to copy and paste the rules above.

Learn more to use the Chakra CLI command to generate snippets, typings, and download Pro blocks

The Chakra UI CLI can be used to generate typings for your custom theme tokens, like colors, semantic tokens, recipe variants, etc. You can also add community snippets and premium Pro blocks to your project.

In order to use the CLI, you need to install it as a dev dependency in your project:

Use the Chakra CLI to run any of the commands listed below with your preferred package manager.

Generates theme and recipe typings for your custom theme. This helps to provide autocompletion and type safety in your project.

Generates useful component compositions that boost your development speed.

Add premium blocks from Chakra UI Pro to your project. These are professionally designed, fully responsive components that you can customize for your needs.

To use Pro blocks, you need a Chakra UI Pro subscription and API key:

Get your API key from Chakra UI Pro

Set the environment variable:

Or create a .env file in your project root:

Add it to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) for persistence if using environment variables

Generated the file(s) that contain the default theme tokens and recipes so you can have full control over them.

After generating the typings, you need to "Restart TS Server" for the autocomplete to show up.

Alternatively, you can install the @chakra-ui/cli package locally as a dev dependency and run the chakra typegen command to generate the typings.

**Examples**:

```text
npm i -D @chakra-ui/cli
```

```text
npm i -D @chakra-ui/cli

```text
pnpm add -D @chakra-ui/cli

The guide to contributing to Chakra UI v3.0

Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Chakra UI üíñ, you rock!

Here are a few ways you can help improve Chakra UI

Chakra v3.x is a composition of two projects in the Chakra ecosystem, Ark UI and Zag.js. The goal is to maintain as little code as possible in Chakra UI, and delegate the heavy lifting to these projects.

Component logic modelled as a state machine

State machine from Zag.js converted to headless UI components

The mindset for filing issues on Chakra v3.x works like this:

If the issue is a logic or accessibility bug, then it's most likely a bug in Zag.js. Consider opening an issue in the Zag.js repository.

If it's a styling issue, then you can fix it directly in the Chakra UI repo.

The mindset for filing feature requests on Chakra v3.x works like this:

If the feature is a new component without logic, then it can go in Chakra UI or Ark UI. Start a discussion on the Chakra UI repository

If the feature is a new component with logic, it belongs in Zag.js. Start a discussion on the Zag.js repository.

We recommend using the following extensions in your editor:

**Examples**:

```text
apps/compositions/src/examples
```

```text
git clone https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git
```

```text
git clone https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git

Bridging the gap between AI agents and Chakra UI

The Chakra UI MCP Server is a specialized Model Context Protocol server that provides AI assistants (like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot) with access to the Chakra UI component library, design tokens, and migration guidance.

The Chakra UI MCP exposes the following tools to AI agents:

These tools provide AI agents with access to well-designed, fully responsive, and accessible component templates from Chakra UI Pro.

The MCP server currently supports only stdio transport and is published at @chakra-ui/react-mcp.

Make sure you have the GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions installed.

In the .vscode/mcp.json file at the root of your project, add the MCP server block:

The MCP server is now ready to use. Click on Start on the MCP server.

In the .cursor/mcp.json file at the root of your project, add the following configuration:

If Cursor doesn't automatically detect the changes, restart the editor or manually enable the Chakra UI server via "MCP Tools."

Make sure you have Claude Code installed. Visit Anthropic docs for installation instructions.

Run the following command in your terminal to add the Chakra UI MCP server:

The MCP server is now ready to use. Start a Claude Code session by running claude.

Navigate to "Settings" > "Windsurf Settings" > "Cascade"

Click the "Manage MCPs" button, then click the "View raw config" button.

Add the following to the MCP configuration file:

.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json

You might need to click the "Refresh" button to see the MCP server in the list.

Go to Settings > Open Settings

In the settings.json file, add MCP server as a new context server

.config/zed/settings.json

To run the MCP server in a local or development environment using a custom MCP client, you need to add the MCP server to the client's configuration file.

To enable access to premium component templates from Chakra UI Pro, you'll need to configure your API key. This requires an active C

Watch the migration livestream (1)

Watch the migration livestream (2)

The minimum node version required is Node.20.x

Remove the unused packages: @emotion/styled and framer-motion. These packages are no longer required in Chakra UI.

Install updated versions of the packages: @chakra-ui/react and @emotion/react.

Next, install component snippets using the CLI snippets. Snippets provide pre-built compositions of Chakra components to save you time and put you in charge.

Move your custom theme to a dedicated theme.js or theme.ts file. Use createSystem and defaultConfig to configure your theme.

All token values need to be wrapped in an object with a value key. Learn more about tokens here.

Update the ChakraProvider import from @chakra-ui/react to the one from the snippets. Next, rename the theme prop to value to match the new system-based theming approach.

If you have a custom theme, replace defaultSystem with the custom system

The Provider component compose the ChakraProvider from Chakra and ThemeProvider from next-themes

Performance: Improved reconciliation performance by 4x and re-render performance by 1.6x

Namespaced imports: Import components using the dot notation for more concise imports

TypeScript: Improved IntelliSense and type inference for style props and tokens.

Polymorphism: Loosened the as prop typings in favor of using the asChild prop. This pattern was inspired by Radix Primitives and Ark UI.

We removed the hooks package in favor of using dedicated, robust libraries like react-use and usehooks-ts

The only hooks we ship now are useBreakpointValue, useCallbackRef, useDisclosure, useControllableState and useMediaQuery.

We removed the styleConfig and multiStyleConfig concept in favor of recipes and slot recipes. This pattern was inspired by Panda CSS.

We've removed the @chakra-ui/next-js package in favor of using the asChild prop for better flexibility.

To style the Next.js image component, use the a

Snippets are pre-built components that you can use to build your UI faster. Using the @chakra-ui/cli you can add snippets to your project.

If you're using TypeScript, you need to update the compilerOptions in the tsconfig file to include the following options:

Create a components/ui/iframe-provider.tsx file to setup the iframe using the react-frame-component package.

components/ui/iframe-provider.tsx

Wrap your application with the Provider component generated in the components/ui/provider component at the root of your application.

This provider composes the following:

At any component in your application, wrap it with the IframeProvider component to render it inside the iframe.

If you created a custom theme using the createSystem function, ensure it's passed to the IframeProvider and Provider components to ensure it's used inside the iframe.

For example, let's say you created a custom theme:

Then, pass it to the IframeProvider and Provider components:

**Examples**:

```text
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/cache react-frame-component

Adding the suppressHydrationWarning prop to the html element is required to prevent the warning about the next-themes library.

We recommend using the experimental.optimizePackageImports feature in Next.js to optimize your bundle size by loading only the modules that you are actually using.
