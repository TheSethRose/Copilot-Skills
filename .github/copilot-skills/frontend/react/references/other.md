  - Dan Abramov
  - Eli White
  - Hendrik Liebau
  - Jack Pope
  - Jason Bonta

React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

Andrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.

Dan got into programming after he accidentally discovered Visual Basic inside Microsoft PowerPoint. He has found his true calling in turning Sebastian’s tweets into long-form blog posts. Dan occasionally wins at Fortnite by hiding in a bush until the game ends.

Eli got into programming after he got suspended from middle school for hacking. He has been working on React and React Native since 2017. He enjoys eating treats, especially ice cream and apple pie. You can find Eli trying quirky activities like parkour, indoor skydiving, and aerial silks.

Hendrik’s journey in tech started in the late 90s when he built his first websites with Netscape Communicator. After earning a diploma in computer science and working at digital agencies, he built a React Server Components bundler and library, paving the way to his role on the Next.js team. Outside of work, he enjoys cycling and tinkering in his workshop.

Shortly after being introduced to AutoHotkey, Jack had written scripts to automate everything he could think of. When reaching limitations there, he dove headfirst into web app development and hasn’t looked back. Most recently, Jack worked on the web platform at Instagram before moving to React. His favorite programming language is JSX.

Jason abandoned embedded C for a career in front-end engineering and never looked back. Armed with esoteric CSS knowledge

At React Conf 2024, Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth shared a welcome message to kick off the conference:

In the Day 1 keynote, we shared vision for React starting with React 19 and the React Compiler. Watch the full keynote from Joe Savona, Lauren Tan, Andrew Clark, Josh Story, Sathya Gunasekaran, and Mofei Zhang:

React 19 introduced new features including Actions, use(), useOptimistic and more. For a deep dive on using new features in React 19, see Sam Selikoff’s talk:

Lydia Hallie gave a visual deep dive of React 19’s new features:

Josh Story provided a deep dive on the document and resource streaming APIs in React 19:

Dan Abramov imagined an alternate history where React started server-first:

Lauren Tan gave a talk on using the React Compiler in practice:

Sathya Gunasekaran and Mofei Zhang provided a deep dive on how the React Compiler works:

We also heard talks from the community on Server Components:

Talks from React frameworks using new features:

And Q&As with the React and React Native teams:

You can watch all of the talks at React Conf 2024 at conf2024.react.dev.

In the keynote, we shared our vision for the future of React starting with React 18.

Watch the full keynote from Andrew Clark, Juan Tejada, Lauren Tan, and Rick Hanlon here:

For a demo of upgrading to React 18, see Shruti Kapoor’s talk here:

React 18 also includes improvements to server-side rendering performance using Suspense.

Streaming server rendering lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and stream that HTML to your users. In React 18, you can use Suspense to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster.

For a deep dive, see Shaundai Person’s talk here:

For React 18, we created our first Working Gr

## Versioning Policy – React

**Contents**:
- Versioning Policy
- Stable releases
  - Breaking changes
  - Commitment to stability
  - Gradual upgrades via warnings
  - What counts as a breaking change?
  - If a minor release includes no new features, why isn’t it a patch?
- All release channels

All stable builds of React go through a high level of testing and follow semantic versioning (semver). React also offers unstable release channels to encourage early feedback on experimental features. This page describes what you can expect from React releases.

This versioning policy describes our approach to version numbers for packages such as react and react-dom. For a list of previous releases, see the Versions page.

Stable React releases (also known as “Latest” release channel) follow semantic versioning (semver) principles.

That means that with a version number x.y.z:

Major releases can also contain new features, and any release can include bug fixes.

Minor releases are the most common type of release.

We know our users continue to use old versions of React in production. If we learn of a security vulnerability in React, we release a backported fix for all major versions that are affected by the vulnerability.

Breaking changes are inconvenient for everyone, so we try to minimize the number of major releases – for example, React 15 was released in April 2016 and React 16 was released in September 2017, and React 17 was released in October 2020.

Instead, we release new features in minor versions. That means that minor releases are often more interesting and compelling than majors, despite their unassuming name.

As we change React over time, we try to minimize the effort required to take advantage of new features. When possible, we’ll keep an older API working, even if that means putting it in a separate package. For example, mixins have been discouraged for years but they’re supported to this day via create-react-class and many codebases continue to use them in stable, legacy code.

Over a million developers use React, collectively maintaining millions of components. The Facebook codebase alone has over 50,000 React components. That means we need to make it as easy as possible to upgrade to new versions of React; if we make large changes without a migra
