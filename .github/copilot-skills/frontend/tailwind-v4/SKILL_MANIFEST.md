## Key v4 Improvements Highlighted

This skill emphasizes Tailwind v4-specific features:

1. **CSS Variables as First-Class**
   - `@import "tailwindcss";` (not `@tailwind` directives)
   - Theme variables accessed via `var(--color-blue-500)`
   - Custom properties via `@theme { --my-color: #123456; }`

2. **Improved Plugin System**
   - Vite plugin integration with `@tailwindcss/vite`
   - Simpler postcss setup with `@tailwindcss/postcss`

3. **Enhanced Responsive Features**
   - Container queries with `@container` and `@sm`, `@md`, etc.
   - Custom breakpoints and container sizes
   - `max-*` variants for breakpoint ranges

4. **Variant Stacking**
   - Left-to-right variant application
   - Complex selectors: `dark:hover:md:flex`
