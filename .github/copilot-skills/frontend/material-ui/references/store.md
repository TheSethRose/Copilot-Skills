UI Foundations Kit is a SaaS starter for Material UI apps. It contains components, hooks, styles, and modules helpful for developers who are building dashboards for consumers, businesses, or internal teams.

It features a beautiful default theme and easily copy/paste-able UI components to build dashboards and apps faster.

See the differences between the default Material UI theme and the UI Foundations theme in the docs →.

UI Foundations Kit offers all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern dashboard starter, including:

The best way to get a feel for what is available is by clicking around the live preview yourself!

With your purchase, you get access to the starter template codebase, with the different frameworks and flavors of JavaScript listed below:

In addition to all the components used in the live preview that are included in the source code, the Plus, and Extended licenses also include a library of easily copy/pasteable Material UI components with no external dependencies and simple state and data requirements.

This makes them ideal for lifting individual modules into your project, or extracting just the pieces you are interested in, and integrating them with your logic or state management.

All the components used in the live preview are available for use as well, but are interdependent on state and imports from other components in the dashboard, making them more attuned for use as a starter template that you make changes to instead.

You can read more about the differences between "App" and "Kit" components in the docs.

The following pages demonstrate the included App components and their functionality within a working dashboard. Kit Components can be copied and pasted to modify the layout or add new charts or functionality:

A few commonly requested features for some teams are not included as part of UI Foundations Kit. If you are interested in seeing these features, feel free to reach out on Twitter or via email.
