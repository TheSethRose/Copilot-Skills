## How to customize - Material UI

    - Why do I need to increase specificity to override one component state?
    - What custom state classes are available in Material UI?

Learn how to customize Material UI components by taking advantage of different strategies for specific use cases.

Material UI provides several different ways to customize a component's styles. Your specific context will determine which one is ideal. From narrowest to broadest use case, here are the options:

To change the styles of one single instance of a component, you can use one of the following options:

The sx prop is the best option for adding style overrides to a single instance of a component in most cases. It can be used with all Material UI components.

To customize a specific part of a component, you can use the class name provided by Material UI inside the sx prop. As an example, let's say you want to change the Slider component's thumb from a circle to a square.

First, use your browser's dev tools to identify the class for the component slot you want to override.

The styles injected into the DOM by Material UI rely on class names that all follow a standard pattern: [hash]-Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot].

In this case, the styles are applied with .css-ae2u5c-MuiSlider-thumb but you only really need to target the .MuiSlider-thumb, where Slider is the component and thumb is the slot. Use this class name to write a CSS selector within the sx prop (& .MuiSlider-thumb), and add your overrides.

These class names can't be used as CSS selectors because they are unstable.

If you want to override a component's styles using custom classes, you can use the className prop, available on each component. To override the styles of a specific part of the component, use the global classes provided by Material UI, as described in the previous section "Overriding nested component styles" under the sx prop section.

Visit the Style library interoperability guide to find examples of this approach using different styling libraries.

States like hover, focus, disabled and selected, are styled with a higher CSS specificity. To customize them, you'll need to increase

**Examples**:

```tsx
<Slider defaultValue={30} sx={{ width: 300, color: 'success.main' }} />
```

```tsx
<Slider
  defaultValue={30}
  sx={{
    width: 300,
    color: 'success.main',
    '& .MuiSlider-thumb': {
      borderRadius: '1px',
    },
  }}
/>
```

```css
.Button {
  color: black;
}

/* Increase the specificity */
.Button:disabled {
  color: white;
}
```

## Installation - Material UI

**URL**: https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

**Contents**:
- Installation
- Default installation
  - Peer dependencies
  - React 18 and below
    - Why is this needed?
- With styled-components
- Roboto font
  - Google Web Fonts

Install Material UI, the world's most popular React UI framework.

Run one of the following commands to add Material UI to your project:

Please note that react and react-dom are peer dependencies, meaning you should ensure they are installed before installing Material UI.

If you are using React 18 or below, you need to set up a resolution of react-is package to the same version as the react you are using.

For example, if you are using react@18.3.1, do the following steps:

Material UI uses react-is@19, which changed how React elements are identified.

If you're on React 18 or below, mismatched versions of react-is can cause runtime errors in prop type checks. Forcing react-is to match your React version prevents these errors.

Material UI uses Emotion as its default styling engine. If you want to use styled-components instead, run one of the following commands:

Next, follow the styled-components how-to guide to properly configure your bundler to support @mui/styled-engine-sc.

As of late 2021, styled-components is not compatible with server-rendered Material UI projects. This is because babel-plugin-styled-components isn't able to work with the styled() utility inside @mui packages. See this GitHub issue for more details.

We strongly recommend using Emotion for SSR projects.

Material UI uses the Roboto font by default. Add it to your project via Fontsource, or with the Google Fonts CDN.

Then you can import it in your entry point like this:

Fontsource can be configured to load specific subsets, weights and styles. Material UI's default typography configuration relies only on the 300, 400, 500, and 700 font weights.

To install Roboto through the Google Web Fonts CDN, add the following code inside your project's <head /> tag:

To use the font Icon component or the prebuilt SVG Material Icons (such as those found in the icon demos), you must first install the Material Icons font. You can do so with npm, or with the Google Web Fonts CDN.

To install the Material

**Examples**:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
},
```

```bash
npm install react-is@18.3.1
```

  - Why is Material UI a "crowd-funded open-source project"?

Support the development of the open-source projects of the MUI organization through crowdfunding.

Material UI, MUI Base, MUI System, and Joy UI are crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the permissive MIT license. Sponsorship increases the rate of bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development.

Diamond sponsors are those who've pledged $1,500/month or more to the MUI organization. Tier benefits.

Gold sponsors are those who've pledged $500/month or more to the MUI organization. Tier benefits.

Silvers sponsors are those who've pledged $250/month to $500/month to the MUI organization. Tier benefits.

Bronze sponsors are those who've pledged $100/month to $250/month to the MUI organization. Tier benefits.

Material UI (as well as MUI Base, MUI System, and Joy UI) is open-source to give users great freedom in how they use the software and to enable the community to have influence over how the project progresses to make it appropriate for a wide range of use cases. To ensure that these open-source libraries can stand the test of time for our users, they need to be well-directed and financially sustainable.

The absolute best way to support the MUI organization to work on its libraries' ongoing development efforts is to become a sponsor. Crowd-sourced funding enables us to spend the most time directly working on improving the open-source projects, which you and the rest of the community then benefit from.

Sponsorship money is used to fund open-source software development, testing, documentation, and releases of the projects.

Users are not obligated to give back to Material UI, but it is in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals and reducing running costs, the open-source libraries result in huge time and money savings for users. We e

**Contents**:
- Usage
- Quickstart
- Globals
  - Responsive meta tag
  - CssBaseline
  - Default font

Learn the basics of working with Material UI components.

After installation, you can import any Material UI component and start playing around. For example, try changing the variant on the Button to outlined to see how the style changes:

Since Material UI components are built to function in isolation, they don't require any kind of globally scoped styles. For a better user experience and developer experience, we recommend adding the following globals to your app.

Material UI is a mobile-first component libraryâ€”we write code for mobile devices first, and then scale up the components as necessary using CSS media queries.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your <head> element:

Material UI provides an optional CssBaseline component. It fixes some inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing resets that are better tailored to fit Material UI than alternative global style sheets like normalize.css.

Material UI uses the Roboto font by default. See Installationâ€”Roboto font for complete details.
