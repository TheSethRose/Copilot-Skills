Astro is an all-in-one web framework that enables you to build performant static websites. People choose Astro when they want to build content-rich experiences with as little JavaScript as possible.

You can deploy a static Astro app to Vercel with zero configuration.

To get started with Astro on Vercel:

Get started in minutes

A minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme.

Starter template for startups, marketing websites & blogs built with Astro and TailwindCSS.

The official 'Getting Started' template for Astro.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Astro project.

To deploy a server-rendered Astro app, or a static Astro site with Vercel features like Web Analytics and Image Optimization, you must:

Add Astro's Vercel adapter to your project. There are two ways to do so:

Configure your project. In your astro.config.ts file, import either the serverless or static plugin, and set the output to server or static respectively:

Enable Vercel's features using Astro's configuration options. The following example astro.config.ts enables Web Analytics and adds a maximum duration to Vercel Function routes:

The following configuration options enable Vercel's features for Astro deployments.

For more details on the configuration options, see Astro's docs.

Using SSR, or on-demand rendering as Astro calls it, enables you to deploy your routes as Vercel functions on Vercel. This allows you to add dynamic elements to your app, such as user logins and personalized content.

You can enable SSR by adding the Vercel adapter to your project.

If your Astro project is statically rendered, you can opt individual routes. To do so:

Set your output option to hybrid in your <PreferredExtension filename="astro.config" mjs />:

Add export const prerender = false; to your components:

Web framework built on Web Standards

Nitro is a next generation server toolkit.

The MCP framework for building AI-powered tools

If you are transitioning from a fully managed server or containerized environment to Vercelâ€™s serverless architecture, you may need to rethink a few concepts in your application since there is no longer a server always running in the background.

The following are generally applicable to serverless, and therefore Vercel Functions (running with or without Fluid compute):

Serverless functions have maximum execution limits and should respond as quickly as possible. They should not subscribe to data events. Instead, we need a client that subscribes to data events and a serverless functions that publishes new data. Consider using a serverless friendly realtime data provider.

To manage database connections efficiently, use the attachDatabasePool function from @vercel/functions.

Create React App (CRA) is a development environment for building single-page applications with the React framework. It sets up and configures a new React project with the latest JavaScript features, and optimizes your app for production.

To get started with CRA on Vercel:

Get started in minutes

A client-side React app created with create-react-app.

React application that implements user login, logout and sign-up features using Auth0.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your CRA project.

On Vercel, static files are replicated and deployed to every region in our global CDN after the first request. This ensures that static files are served from the closest location to the visitor, improving performance and reducing latency.

Static files are cached for up to 31 days. If a file is unchanged, it can persist across deployments, as their hash caches static files. However, the cache is effectively invalidated when you redeploy, so we always serve the latest version.

To summarize, using Static Files with CRA on Vercel:

Learn more about static files caching

When you deploy your CRA app to Vercel and connect your git repo, every pull request will generate a Preview Deployment.

Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your app in a live deployment. They are available by default for all projects, and are generated when you commit changes to a Git branch with an open pull request, or you create a deployment using Vercel CLI.

You can use the comments feature to receive feedback on your Preview Deployments from Vercel Team members and people you share the Preview URL with.

Comments allow you to start discussion threads, share screenshots, send notifications, and more.

To summarize, Preview Deployments with CRA on Vercel:

You may also run your application using the app.listen pattern that exposes the server on a port.

Use vercel dev to run your application locally

To deploy, connect your Git repository or use Vercel CLI:

To serve static assets, place them in the public/** directory. They will be served as a part of our CDN using default headers unless otherwise specified in vercel.json.

express.static() will be ignored and will not serve static assets.

When you deploy an Express app to Vercel, your Express application becomes a single Vercel Function and uses Fluid compute by default. This means your Express app will automatically scale up and down based on traffic.

Additionally, all Vercel Functions limitations apply to the Express application, including:

Gatsby is an open-source static-site generator. It enables developers to build fast and secure websites that integrate different content, APIs, and services.

Gatsby also has a large ecosystem of plugins and tools that improve the development experience. Vercel supports many Gatsby features, including Server-Side Rendering, Deferred Static Generation, API Routes, and more.

To get started with Gatsby on Vercel:

Get started in minutes

A Gatsby starter template using v5.

Turborepo & Gatsby Starter

This is an official starter Turborepo with a Gatsby app, a Next.js app, and a React.js component library shared by both applications.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Gatsby project.

Gatsby v4+ sites deployed to Vercel will automatically detect Gatsby usage and install the @vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-builder plugin.

To deploy your Gatsby site to Vercel, do not install the @vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-builder plugin yourself, or add it to your gatsby-config.js file.

Gatsby v5 sites require Node.js 20 or higher.

Vercel persists your Gatsby project's .cache directory across builds.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, verifying authentication or checking the geolocation of an incoming request.

Vercel offers SSR that scales down resource consumption when traffic is low, and scales up with traffic surges. This protects your site from accruing costs during periods of no traffic or losing business during high-traffic periods.

You can server-render pages in your Gatsby application on Vercel using Gatsby's native Server-Side Rendering API. These pages will be deployed to Vercel as Vercel functions.

To server-render a Gatsby page, you must export an async function called getServerData. The function can return an object with several optional key

*[Content truncated - see full docs]*

**Examples**:

```python
import type { GetServerDataProps, GetServerDataReturn } from 'gatsby';
 
type ServerDataProps = {
  hello: string;
};

  const { name } = props.serverData;
  return <div>Hello, {name}</div>;
};
 
export async function getServerData(
  props: GetServerDataProps,
): GetServerDataReturn<ServerDataProps> {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`https://example-data-source.com/api/some-data`);
    return {
      props: await res.json(),
    };
  } catch (error) {
 
...
```

```python
import type { GatsbyNode } from 'gatsby';
 
export const createPages: GatsbyNode['createPages'] = async ({ actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions;
  createPage({
    defer: true,
    path: '/using-dsg',
    component: require.resolve('./src/templates/using-dsg.js'),
    context: {},
  });
};
```

```python
import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';

  - Hono Middleware
  - Vercel Routing Middleware

Hono is a fast and lightweight web application framework built on Web Standards. You can deploy a Hono app to Vercel with zero configuration.

Start with Hono on Vercel by using the following Hono template to deploy to Vercel with zero configuration:

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Hono project.

Get started by initializing a new Hono project using Vercel CLI init command:

This will clone the Hono example repository in a directory called hono.

To run a Hono application on Vercel, create a file that imports the hono package at any one of the following locations:

To run your Hono application locally, use Vercel CLI:

This ensures that the application will use the default export to run the same as when deployed to Vercel. The application will be available on your localhost.

Hono has the concept of "Middleware" as a part of the framework. This is different from Vercel Routing Middleware, though they can be used together.

In Hono, Middleware runs before a request handler in the framework's router. This is commonly used for loggers, CORS handling, or authentication. The code in the Hono application might look like this:

More examples of Hono Middleware can be found in the Hono documentation.

In Vercel, Routing Middleware executes code before a request is processed by the application. This gives you a way to handle rewrites, redirects, headers, and more, before returning a response. See the Routing Middleware documentation for examples.

To serve static assets, place them in the public/** directory. They will be served as a part of our CDN using default headers unless otherwise specified in vercel.json.

Hono's serveStatic() will be ignored and will not serve static assets.

When you deploy a Hono app to Vercel, your server routes automatically become Vercel Functions and use Fluid compute by default.

Vercel Functions support streaming which can be used with Hono's stream() fun

For example, use the following code as an entrypointt:

Use vercel dev to run your application locally

To deploy, connect your Git repository or use Vercel CLI:

When you deploy a NestJS app to Vercel, your NestJS application becomes a single Vercel Function and uses Fluid compute by default. This means your NestJS app will automatically scale up and down based on traffic.

All Vercel Functions limitations apply to the NestJS application, including the size of the application being limited to 250MB.

Get started with Next.js and React in seconds.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Next.js project.

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.

When self-hosting, (ISR) is limited to a single region workload. Statically generated pages are not distributed closer to visitors by default, without additional configuration or vendoring of a CDN. By default, self-hosted ISR does not persist generated pages to durable storage. Instead, these files are located in the Next.js cache (which expires).

To enable ISR with Next.js in the app router, add an options object with a revalidate property to your fetch requests:

To summarize, using ISR with Next.js on Vercel:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.

On Vercel, you can server-render Next.js applications through Vercel Functions.

To summarize, SSR with Next.js on Vercel:

Vercel supports streaming in Next.js projects with any of the following:

Streaming data allows you to fetch information in chunks rather than all at once, speeding up Funct

- Get started with Nitro on Vercel
  - Get started with Vercel CLI
- Using Vercel's features with Nitro
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  - On-demand revalidation
  - Create an Environment Variable
  - Update your configuration

Nitro is a full-stack framework with TypeScript-first support. It includes filesystem routing, code-splitting for fast startup, built-in caching, and multi-driver storage. It enables deployments from the same codebase to any platform with output sizes under 1MB.

You can deploy a Nitro app to Vercel with zero configuration.

To get started with Nitro on Vercel, use the following Nitro template to deploy to Vercel with zero configuration:

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Nitro project.

Get started by initializing a new Nitro project using Vercel CLI init command:

This will clone the Nitro example repository in a directory called nitro.

When you deploy a Nitro app to Vercel, you can use Vercel specific features such as Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), preview deployments, Fluid compute, Observability, and Vercel firewall with zero or minimum configuration.

ISR allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.

With on-demand revalidation, you can purge the cache for an ISR route whenever you want, foregoing the time interval required with background revalidation.

To revalidate a path to a prerendered function:

Create an Environment Variable to store a revalidation secret by:

Update your configuration to use the revalidation secret as follows:

You can revalidate a path to a prerendered function by making a GET or HEAD request to that path with a header of x-prerender-revalidate: bypassToken

When the prerendered function endpoint is accessed with this header set, the cache will be revalidated. The next request to that function will return a fresh response.

To have more control over ISR caching, you can pass an options object to the isr route rule as shown below:

By default, query parameters are ignored by cache unless you specify them in the

Nuxt.js 3 Boilerplate

A Nuxt.js 3 app, bootstrapped with create-nuxt-app.

A link-in-bio SaaS built with Nuxt.js, where the data lives in the URL â€“ no database required.

Open source changelog template made with Nuxt, Vue, and Tailwindcss.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Nuxt project.

The following table outlines the differences between nuxt build and nuxt generate on Vercel:

In general, nuxt build is likely best for most use cases. Consider using nuxt generate to build fully static sites.

You can configure your Nuxt deployment by creating a Nuxt config file in your project's root directory. It can be a TypeScript, JavaScript, or MJS file, but the Nuxt team recommends using TypeScript. Using TypeScript will allow your editor to suggest the correct names for configuration options, which can help mitigate typos.

Your Nuxt config file should default export defineNuxtConfig by default, which you can add an options object to.

The following is an example of a Nuxt config file with no options defined:

See the Nuxt Configuration Reference docs for a list of available options.

With the routeRules config option, you can:

At the moment, there is no way to configure route deployment options within your page components, but development of this feature is in progress.

React Router is a multi-strategy router for React. When used as a framework, React Router enables fullstack, server-rendered React applications. Its built-in features for nested pages, error boundaries, transitions between loading states, and more, enable developers to create modern web apps.

With Vercel, you can deploy React Router applications with server-rendering or static site generation (using SPA mode) to Vercel with zero configuration.

It is highly recommended that your application uses the Vercel Preset when deploying to Vercel.

The optional @vercel/react-router package contains Vercel specific utilities for use in React Router applications. The package contains various entry points for specific use cases:

To get started, navigate to the root directory of your React Router project with your terminal and install @vercel/react-router with your preferred package manager:

When using the React Router as a framework, you should configure the Vercel Preset to enable the full feature set that Vercel offers.

To configure the Preset, add the following lines to your react-router.config file:

When this Preset is configured, your React Router application is enhanced with Vercel-specific functionality:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request. Server-Side Rendering is invoked using Vercel Functions.

Routes defined in your application are deployed with server-side rendering by default.

The following example demonstrates a basic route that renders with SSR:

To summarize, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React Router on Vercel:

  - Install SvelteKit's Vercel adapter plugin
  - Add the Vercel adapter to your Svelte config
- Configure your SvelteKit deployment
  - Configuration options

SvelteKit is a frontend framework that enables you to build Svelte applications with modern techniques, such as Server-Side Rendering, automatic code splitting, and advanced routing.

You can deploy your SvelteKit projects to Vercel with zero configuration, enabling you to use Preview Deployments, Web Analytics, Vercel functions, and more.

To get started with SvelteKit on Vercel:

Get started in minutes

SvelteKit Boilerplate

A SvelteKit app including nested routes, layouts, and page endpoints.

SvelteKit Authentication

A SvelteKit app with authentication.

An all-in-one starter kit for high-performance e-commerce sites built with SvelteKit.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your SvelteKit project.

When you create a new SvelteKit project with npm create svelte@latest, it installs adapter-auto by default. This adapter detects that you're deploying on Vercel and installs the @sveltejs/adapter-vercel plugin for you at build time.

We recommend installing the @sveltejs/adapter-vercel package yourself. Doing so will ensure version stability, slightly speed up your CI process, and allows you to configure default deployment options for all routes in your project.

The following instructions will guide you through adding the Vercel adapter to your SvelteKit project.

You can add the Vercel adapter to your SvelteKit project by running the following command:

Add the Vercel adapter to your svelte.config.js file, which should be at the root of your project directory.

You cannot use TypeScript for your SvelteKit config file.

In your svelte.config.js file, import adapter from @sveltejs/adapter-vercel, and add your preferred options. The following example shows the default configuration, which uses the Node.js runtime (which run on Vercel functions).

Learn more about configuring your Vercel deployment in our configuration section below.

Vite is an opinionated build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite provides a dev server with rich feature enhancements such as pre-bundling NPM dependencies and hot module replacement, and a build command that bundles your code and outputs optimized static assets for production.

These features make Vite more desirable than out-of-the-box CLIs when building larger projects with frameworks for many developers.

Vite powers popular frameworks like SvelteKit, and is often used in large projects built with Vue, Svelte, React, Preact, and more.

To get started with Vite on Vercel:

Get started in minutes

Vue-powered Static Site Generator

Vite/Vue.js site that can be deployed to Vercel

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Vite project.

Although Vite offers modern features like SSR and Vercel functions out of the box, implementing those features can sometimes require complex configuration steps. Because of this, many Vite users prefer to use popular community plugins.

Vite's plugins are based on Rollup's plugin interface, giving Vite users access to many tools from the Rollup ecosystem as well as the Vite-specific ecosystem.

We recommend using Vite plugins to configure your project when possible.

vite-plugin-vercel is a popular community Vite plugin that implements the Build Output API spec. It enables your Vite apps to use the following Vercel features:

When using the Vercel CLI, set the port as an environment variable. To allow Vite to access this, include the environment variable in your vite.config file:

vite-plugin-ssr is another popular community Vite plugin that implements the Build Output API spec. It enables your Vite apps to do the following:

Vercel provides a set of System Environment Variables that our platform automatically populates. For example, the VERCEL_GIT_PROVIDER variable exposes the Git provider tha

- xmcp on Vercel
- Get started with xmcp on Vercel
  - Get started with Vercel CLI
- Local development
- Middleware
  - xmcp Middleware
  - Vercel Routing Middleware
- Vercel Functions

xmcp is a TypeScript-first framework for building MCP-compatible backends. It provides an opinionated project structure, automatic tool discovery, and a streamlined middleware layer for request/response processing. You can deploy an xmcp app to Vercel with zero configuration.

Start with xmcp on Vercel by creating a new xmcp project:

This scaffolds a project with a src/tools/ directory for tools, optional src/middleware.ts, and an xmcp.config.ts file.

To deploy, connect your Git repository or use Vercel CLI:

Get started by initializing a new Xmcp project using Vercel CLI init command:

This will clone the Xmcp example repository in a directory called xmcp.

To run your xmcp application locally, you can use Vercel CLI:

Alternatively, use your project's dev script:

In xmcp, an optional middleware.ts lets you run code before and after tool execution. This is commonly used for logging, auth, or request shaping:

In Vercel, Routing Middleware executes before a request is processed by your application. Use it for rewrites, redirects, headers, or personalization, and combine it with xmcp's own middleware as needed.

When you deploy an xmcp app to Vercel, your server endpoints automatically run as Vercel Functions and use Fluid compute by default.

**Examples**:

```text
npx create-xmcp-app@latest
```

```text
vc init xmcp
```

```text
npm run dev
yarn dev
pnpm run dev
```
