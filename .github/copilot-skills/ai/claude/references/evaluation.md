Task fidelity (sentiment analysis) - exact match evaluation

Consistency (FAQ bot) - cosine similarity evaluation

Relevance and coherence (summarization) - ROUGE-L evaluation

Tone and style (customer service) - LLM-based Likert scale

Privacy preservation (medical chatbot) - LLM-based binary classification

Context utilization (conversation assistant) - LLM-based ordinal scale

Example: LLM-based grading

**Examples**:

```python
import anthropic

tweets = [
    {"text": "This movie was a total waste of time. ðŸ‘Ž", "sentiment": "negative"},
    {"text": "The new album is ðŸ”¥! Been on repeat all day.", "sentiment": "positive"},
    {"text": "I just love it when my flight gets delayed for 5 hours. #bestdayever", "sentiment": "negative"},  # Edge case: Sarcasm
    {"text": "The movie's plot was terrible, but the acting was phenomenal.", "sentiment": "mixed"},  # Edge case: Mixed sentiment
    # ... 996 more tweets
]

client = a

    {"questions": ["I bought something last week, and it's not really what I expected, so I was wondering if maybe I could possibly return it?", "I read online that your policy is 30 days but that seems like it might be out
