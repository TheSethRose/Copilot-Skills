# Tasks: Copilot Skills Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-skill-architecture/`  
**Prerequisites**: ‚úÖ plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/interaction-contracts.md, quickstart.md  
**Status**: Phase 2 - Ready for implementation  
**Date**: October 18, 2025

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create the skills directory structure and initialize the project for the architecture

- [x] T001 Create `.github/copilot-skills/` directory structure with subdirectories: `index.md` location, example skill template location, and scripts subdirectory
- [x] T002 Create `.github/copilot-skills/index.md` skeleton with registry structure and format guidance
- [x] T003 [P] Create `.specify/templates/skill-template/` with boilerplate SKILL.md template for new skills

- [x] T011 Create documentation update plan: ensure `.github/copilot-instructions.md` mentions skills discovery workflow

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - skills registry and core documentation in place. User story implementation can now begin.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - AI Agent Discovers Available Skills (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable developers to discover available skills through `.github/copilot-skills/index.md` registry

**Independent Test**: Developer can open `.github/copilot-skills/index.md`, find skill descriptions and paths, and Copilot can identify relevant skills based on task description

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Create `.github/copilot-skills/index.md` with SkillsRegistry structure listing: skill name, path, description, when-to-use, tags (template from data-model.md)
- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Create example skill entry in index.md using `hello-skill` as reference (name, description, when-to-use, tags format)
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Create `.github/copilot-skills/hello-skill/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter example (name, description, version, tags, dependencies)

- [x] T018 [US1] Validate index.md entries have all required fields per SkillMetadata in data-model.md

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete - Skills are discoverable. Index.md shows available skills, Copilot can identify relevance.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Load Skill Details Progressively (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable progressive disclosure where users access increasingly detailed information in layers

**Independent Test**: User loads SKILL.md and understands core capabilities; then navigates to linked detail files for deeper information on specific topics

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T019 [P] [US2] Create `.github/copilot-skills/hello-skill/reference.md` demonstrating detail file pattern with API documentation and reference material (200+ lines format per data-model.md)
- [x] T020 [P] [US2] Add linking examples in `.github/copilot-skills/hello-skill/SKILL.md` showing how to reference detail files with relative markdown links
- [x] T021 [P] [US2] Create `.github/copilot-skills/hello-skill/forms.md` demonstrating form-filling patterns and form-specific use cases (optional detail file)
- [x] T022 [US2] Document four-layer progressive disclosure model in `.github/copilot-skills/README.md` (Index ‚Üí SKILL.md ‚Üí Detail files ‚Üí Scripts)
- [x] T023 [US2] Add progressive disclosure workflow to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` showing how Copilot navigates from SKILL.md to detail files
- [ ] T024 [US2] Create validation checklist in `.specify/checklists/` ensuring detail files are independently readable (each can be read without reading others)
- [x] T025 [US2] Add "Detail File Authoring" section to `.github/copilot-skills/AUTHORING.md` with requirements (single topic, linked from SKILL.md, examples)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete - Progressive disclosure works. SKILL.md is scannable in <3 minutes; detail files provide deep dives on specific topics.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Execute Deterministic Skill Operations (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable developers to run bundled scripts with consistent, documented results

**Independent Test**: Developer can run a bundled script from `.github/copilot-skills/{skill}/scripts/` and get deterministic, documented results matching skill patterns

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T026 [P] [US3] Create example scripts in `.github/copilot-skills/hello-skill/scripts/` directory with stubs for Python (extract_data.py) and Shell (process.sh) examples
- [x] T027 [P] [US3] Create `.github/copilot-skills/hello-skill/scripts/hello-example.py` with input/output contract documentation (accepts --format flag, returns JSON with success/errors/data fields)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - Scripts are bundled, documented, and produce deterministic results. Developers understand input/output contracts.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Integrate Skills into Project Workflow (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Connect skills architecture to normal project workflows and governance

**Independent Test**: Developer can read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and understand skills exist, where to find them, and how to use them in development workflow

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T033 [P] [US4] Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` "Skills" section with examples of skill references for different task types (PDF handling, compliance, document processing)
- [x] T034 [P] [US4] Add "When to Create a New Skill" section to `.github/copilot-skills/AUTHORING.md` with decision criteria and anti-patterns

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY

**For next steps, see**: `/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **User Story 1 (US1)** and **User Story 2 (US2)**: Can proceed in parallel (both P1 priority, no mutual dependencies)
  - **User Story 3 (US3)**: Can start after Foundational - independent of US1/US2
  - **User Story 4 (US4)**: Can start after Foundational - integrates all previous stories
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Discovery)**: Requires Foundational phase - no dependencies on other stories - Can run in parallel with US2/US3
- **US2 (Progressive Loading)**: Requires Foundational phase - no hard dependencies on US1 but works best after US1 is visible in index.md
- **US3 (Script Execution)**: Requires Foundational phase - independent of US1/US2 - Can run in parallel
- **US4 (Workflow Integration)**: Requires US1, US2, US3 complete - integrates all stories into project workflow

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All [P] tasks can run in parallel - different files, no dependencies
- T003, T004, T005 can execute simultaneously

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All [P] tasks can run in parallel - different files, no dependencies
- T008, T009, T010 can execute simultaneously

**User Story 1 & 2** (P1 Priority): Can start simultaneously after Foundational
- US1 builds the registry and hello-skill example (T012-T018)
- US2 builds detail files and progressive disclosure patterns (T019-T025)
- Non-conflicting files - can execute in parallel

**User Story 3** (P2 Priority): Can start after Foundational or after US1
- Scripts and deterministic execution (T026-T032)
- Independent file structure

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: All [P] tasks can run in parallel
- T040, T041, T042, T043, T047 validate different aspects independently

## Notes

- [P] markers indicate parallelizable tasks (different files, no inter-dependencies)
- [Story] labels map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story functionality
- Commit after each task or logical group (T001-T006, T007-T011, etc.)
- All file paths are relative to repository root or specific to `.github/copilot-skills/`
- Constitution principles must be verified in Phase 7 polish via checklist
- Context efficiency (SC-003) should be measured by comparing file sizes: monolithic (50KB) vs. modular (5KB base + 10KB loaded skill)
