# Specification Quality Checklist: Copilot Skills Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Analysis
✅ **PASS**: The specification focuses entirely on user experience and organizational structure. No language, framework, or API details appear.

✅ **PASS**: Written for technical teams who need to understand the architecture and value (not marketing speak).

✅ **PASS**: Includes all mandatory sections: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Key Entities, Success Criteria, and Assumptions.

### Requirement Completeness Analysis
✅ **PASS**: All 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are clear, testable, and use "MUST" language appropriately.

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are all measurable with specific time targets or percentages. Example: "Developers can identify...in under 2 minutes", "60% context reduction"

✅ **PASS**: Edge cases are identified and documented, showing system resilience considerations.

✅ **PASS**: Four user stories cover: discovery, progressive loading, deterministic execution, and integration—each independently testable and valuable.

### Feature Readiness Analysis
✅ **PASS**: All 12 functional requirements map to specific user stories or edge cases.

✅ **PASS**: User scenarios progress from basic (discover skills) to advanced (cross-skill workflows), with clear priorities P1→P3.

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria directly measure the benefits promised in the feature (token efficiency, discoverability, consistency).

## Sign-Off

**Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Run `/speckit.clarify` for stakeholder review (if needed)
- [ ] Run `/speckit.plan` to create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Begin breaking specification into actionable tasks

## Notes

No issues identified. The specification successfully balances completeness with conciseness, providing clear guidance for both planning and implementation phases.
