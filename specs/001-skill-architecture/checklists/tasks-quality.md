---

## Implementation Strategy Alignment

- [ ] CHK069 Do tasks align with the three implementation strategies described (MVP First, Incremental Delivery, Parallel Team)? [Consistency, Spec §Implementation Strategy]

- [ ] CHK080 Does Phase 7 Polish explicitly exclude performance tuning, multi-language support, or other stretch goals? [Scope Clarity, Boundaries]
- [ ] CHK081 Are tasks focused on LOCAL repository setup (`.github/copilot-skills/`) and NOT on external systems or APIs? [Scope, Boundaries]
- [ ] CHK082 Is v1 scope (manual skill registration, single-project skills) clearly distinguished from potential v2 features (multi-project sharing, auto-generation)? [Clarity, Version Boundaries]

---

## Measurement & Success Validation

- [ ] CHK084 Are measurement methodologies defined for SC-003 (context reduction) and SC-004 (AI metadata clarity)? [Measurability, Metrics]
- [ ] CHK085 Do tasks include acceptance thresholds (e.g., "SKILL.md must be scannable in <3 minutes", not just "must be scannable")? [Measurability, Thresholds]
- [ ] CHK086 Is context reduction (60% savings) measured by comparing actual file sizes or estimated impact? [Clarity, Measurement Approach]
- [ ] CHK087 Are success metrics from plan.md and spec.md explicitly called out in Phase 7 validation tasks? [Traceability, Coverage]

---

## Final Review Items

- [ ] CHK088 Does the task list avoid duplication (e.g., two tasks updating the same file without clear sequential dependency)? [Efficiency]
- [ ] CHK089 Are there obvious task gaps that would prevent reaching "production ready" state after Phase 7? [Completeness]
